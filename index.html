    <h3 class="media-heading">Scout</h3>
    <p>This is my daughter, Scout. She's pretty awesome. She's in 4th grade and is super good at math and is always interested in things that I am working on in my classes. She says that I am "Big Brain" because I know a little bit of coding. When we go to different places she always makes a friend. When I tell her that her clothes don't match she just nods and says, "Scouty Style". Her hair collects twigs.</p>

    <h3 class="media-heading">Avi</h3>
    <p>This is my son, Avi. He reminds me every day that he's almost as tall as me. He's in 6th grade and is starting to think I'm not as cool as I once was. He wants to be a glass blower and is an amazing bass player. He doesn't like watching movies so we have to call them "shows". We watch a lot of "shows" together on the weekends. He loves using his 3D printer and making fun of me. If he is around other people and I acknowledge that he exists he does not talk to me for the rest of the day. I will never show him this website.</p>
