    <p>My name is Ben. I am a normal 44 year old human person. I enjoy hiking, baking bread, writing songs and bad stories, and occasionally leaving my house and interacting with other human people. I don't expect you to believe me but I have been a gainfully employed school librarian for 16 years. I have a family that I love very much. We live in a quiet little village called Brooktondale outside of Ithaca, NY. Brooktondale is where hippies go to die.</p>

    <h3 class="media-heading">Scout</h3>
    <p>This is my daughter, Scout. She's pretty awesome. She's in 4th grade and is super good at math and is always interested in things that I am working on in my classes. She says that I am "Big Brain" because I know a little bit of coding. When we go to different places she always makes a friend. When I tell her that her clothes don't match she just nods and says, "Scouty Style". Her hair collects twigs. She likes this website.</p>

    <h3 class="media-heading">Avi</h3>
    <p>This is my son, Avi. He reminds me every day that he's almost as tall as me. He's in 6th grade and is starting to think I'm not as cool as I once was. He wants to be a glass blower and is an amazing bass player. He doesn't like watching movies so we have to call them "shows". We watch a lot of "shows" together on the weekends. He loves using his 3D printer and making fun of me. If he is around other people and I acknowledge that he exists he does not talk to me for the rest of the day. I will never show him this website.</p>

    <p>This is my wife, Amy. She puts up with me and tells me when to eat and go to sleep. I did not tell her why I was taking this picture. I will never show her this website.</p>
